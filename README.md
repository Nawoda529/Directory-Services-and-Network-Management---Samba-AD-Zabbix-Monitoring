# 🛠️ Directory Services & Network Management – Final Assignment  

Welcome to the official repository for my final submission for the **IE3020 – Directory Services and Network Management** course. This assignment showcases a hands-on implementation of a **Samba Active Directory (AD) Domain Controller** and **Zabbix Network Monitoring**, combining both theory and practical application to demonstrate skills in system administration, AD domain management, and Linux-based monitoring solutions.

---

## 📄 Assignment Overview

This assignment involves the setup of a complete domain environment using open-source tools, focusing on:

1. **Samba AD Domain Controller** configuration on Ubuntu.
2. **Linux client integration** into the AD domain using realmd, sssd, and Kerberos.
3. **Zabbix monitoring setup** for real-time status tracking of the domain and client.

Each section is accompanied by screenshots, configuration snippets, and explanations to help replicate the steps in a lab environment.
